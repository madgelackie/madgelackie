### Hi there 👋 I'm Marion.

I'm an early-career software developer.  I've so far worked in Python, Javascript and Java languages, used React and Flask web frameworks and PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases.  I come from an audiology background so it's taking me a while to break the habit of writing 'dB' and start writing 'db' 🎵 

In the near-future I plan to:
☁️ learn more about cloud computing
🔒learn more about authentication across the full stack
...

Fun fact - I love a bit of Energy geekery - [hello National Grid ESO's Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/). This is the kind of thing that drew me to tech.
