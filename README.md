### Hi 👋 I'm Marion.

I'm an early-career software developer.  

I've so far worked in
* 🐍 Python   ⏱ Javascript    🧱 Java     
* ⚛️ React     🍟 Flask        
* 💻 PostgreSQL   💃🕺 MongoDB 

I have a background in audiology so it's taking me a while to break the habit of writing 'dB' and start writing 'db' 🎵 

In the near-future I plan to:
* ☁️ learn more about cloud computing
* 🔒learn more about authentication across the full stack

I'm sure that list will never stop growing 👍

Fun fact: I love a bit of Energy geekery - hello [National Grid ESO's Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/). This is the kind of thing that drew me to a career in tech.
