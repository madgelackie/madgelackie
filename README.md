### Hi 👋 I'm Marion.

I'm an early-career software developer.  

I've so far worked in
* 🐍 Python 
* Javascript
* 🧱Java
* ⚛️React
* Flask
* PostgreSQL and 
* MongoDB 

I come from an audiology background so it's taking me a while to break the habit of writing 'dB' and start writing 'db' 🎵 

In the near-future I plan to:
* ☁️ learn more about cloud computing
* 🔒learn more about authentication across the full stack

I'm sure that list will never stop growing 👍

Fun fact - I love a bit of Energy geekery - [hello National Grid ESO's Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/). This is the kind of thing that drew me to tech.
